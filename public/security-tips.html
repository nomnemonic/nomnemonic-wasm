                The security tips are just helpers to run the deterministic mnemonic generator in a more secure
                environment and more reliable way. It does NOT mean that you should obey the tips!

                <li>
                    Use your browser in Private mode without any extension enabled.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check your address bar and ensure that you are using a reliable source to load the app.

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the page is loaded successfully, ensure the `library version` and the `algorithm version` are
                    printed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After verifying the page is loaded successfully, close the internet connection(the static WASM web
                    page does not make any network request to generate the mnemonics)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use something you know as input for `identifier`, `password`, `passcode` and do not use generic
                    inputs like `test`, `001234`. Use a very strong `password`, there is no character limit at max.
                    Ensure that you can remember what you have entered before using, the idea is to remove the storage
                    of a lot words but also to re-generate the words with the same inputs you have entered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check `id`, `password` and `passcode` entry accuracy for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Generate words twice and check if it can generate the same words(to ensure the determinism, incase
                    if it can't report bug!).
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you have copied all the words using `Copy words` button, after using the words, copy something
                    else to the clipboard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use `Reset` button to reset the page inputs and close the page before enabling the internet
                    connection.
