                This WebAssembly(WASM) app hosted by Cloudflare pages
                (check Cloudflare privacy policy if you have concerns) and
                Github pages (check Github privacy policy if you have concerns)
                for free. It does not have its own server. The app itself does
                not require any network connection to generate the words.
                It is a static html page that use WASM compiled library to
                produce words. It does not have any storage and it
                does not have/need cookies. The app does not collect/store any
                personal information. The app does not offer any storage
                solution either.
            </p>
            <p>
                To help users on the privacy concerns, it disables autocomplete
                functionality of html inputs and hides the sensitive
                information entry by using password input types.
